<h4>TL;DR: We finalized our name and launched our website!</h4>

<h3>The InMﾅ行hn Website</h3>
<p>We've developed a website to showcase our team and our work progress. The website will includes a blog (not yet actually, but soon邃｢) that will be updated weekly with what InMﾅ行hn's team has been up to that includes what work had been done over the past week and what is currently a work in progress.</p>

<p>For developing the website, I found a really good looking template online and built off of it. The template I used is called <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/">Agency</a> that is built with Bootstrap. The website is completely static and is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. The website is complete but there is still a lot of code from the template that is unused and will remain unused that needs to be removed.</p>

<h3>Whats your Name?</h3>
<p>Cooking up a name for your company/product isn't an easy task. It takes time to come up with a creative name that sounds good and isn't boring. The name is ideally short, easy to remember, available on all social networks (@InMoshn on Twitter, I'm looking at you! 沽｡), not cringey, etcetc. Our process for coming up with names started at: Do we want to name our company or our product?</p>

<p>"Company. Lets name our company", said Darshak in November in my imagination as I was writing this blogpost. We spent a lot of idle time thinking of names and tossing at each other during the months of November and December. Then struck January: We hit and found <b><i>InMﾅ行hn</i></b>. It was great! It fit what we're doing, it sounded nice, it's spelled in a way you would expect a new small company to spell their own name, it was a great name! And so, we settled.*</p>

<sub><sup>* TBH, I randomly came up with this name while making this website and we thought, "ya thats fine...lets stick to it!".</sup></sub>

<p>That's all for this week! I'll leave you with my favourite video/gif of the week at the end of each blog post as a thank you for reading the blogposts 沽</p>

<p>Hilarious ad for an animal shelter! My favourite part: The homemade wacky waving arm inflatable tube mangirl at the beginning.</p>
