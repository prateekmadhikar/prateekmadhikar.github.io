<h4>TL;DR: We finalized our name and launched our website!</h4>

<h3>The InMōshn Website</h3>
<p>We've developed a website to showcase our team and our work progress. The website will includes a blog (not yet actually, but soon™) that will be updated weekly with what InMōshn's team has been up to that includes what work had been done over the past week and what is currently a work in progress.</p>

<p>For developing the website, I found a really good looking template online and built off of it. The template I used is called <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/">Agency</a> that is built with Bootstrap. The website is completely static and is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. The website is complete but there is still a lot of code from the template that is unused and will remain unused that needs to be removed.</p>

<h3>Whats your Name?</h3>
<p>Cooking up a name for your company/product isn't an easy task. It takes time to come up with a creative name that sounds good and isn't boring. The name is ideally short, easy to remember, available on all social networks (@InMoshn on Twitter, I'm looking at you! 😡), not cringey, etcetc. Our process for coming up with names started at: Do we want to name our company or our product?</p>

<p>"Company. Lets name our company", said Darshak in November in my imagination as I was writing this blogpost. We spent a lot of idle time thinking of names and tossing at each other during the months of November and December. Then struck January: We hit and found <b><i>InMōshn</i></b>. It was great! It fit what we're doing, it sounded nice, it's spelled in a way you would expect a new small company to spell their own name, it was a great name! And so, we settled.*</p>

<sub><sup>* TBH, I randomly came up with this name while making this website and we thought, "ya thats fine...lets stick to it!".</sup></sub>

<p>That's all for this week! I'll leave you with my favourite video/gif of the week at the end of each blog post as a thank you for reading the blogposts 😄</p>

<p>Hilarious ad for an animal shelter! My favourite part: The homemade wacky waving arm inflatable tube mangirl at the beginning.</p>
